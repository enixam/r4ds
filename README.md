# Notes on [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).  
This repo is an effort to reproduce content in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) by Hadely Wickham and Garret Grolemund, venturing solutions to its exercises , documenting what I have learned and more. Some text are borrowed and modified from  its [Chinese virsion](https://www.ituring.com.cn/book/2113), most images and diagrams are screenshots taken from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html),  [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) website. Repo for the original book could be found at https://github.com/hadley/r4ds and content at https://r4ds.had.co.nz/.  
I may continue uploading new chapters to keep pace with newest features of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), and sharing packages which I found useful and would facilitate the whole process of data wrangling, tidying, analysis,  etc.
