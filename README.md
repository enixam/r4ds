Notes on Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).  
Some content are borrowed and modified from  its [Chinese virsion](https://www.ituring.com.cn/book/2113). I may upload new chapters to keep it in line with newest features of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), and to introduce useful packages in reference to data science I've encountered.
